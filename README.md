# Automated-Oracle-EBS-Security-Monitor
This project is a security automation tool designed for Oracle EBS environments. It monitors user login attempts within the database and uses a Java-based logic engine to automatically lock accounts that exceed security thresholds (e.g., more than 3 failed attempts), preventing unauthorized access to sensitive financial data.
